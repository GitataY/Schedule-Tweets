# Scheduled Tweets

Scheduled Tweets is a tool that allows users to schedule tweets to be sent at a specific time in the future. This is similar to the functionality provided by the popular social media management tool, Buffer.
With Scheduled Tweets, users can compose their tweets in advance and set the date and time for them to be sent. This feature can be useful for scheduling tweets to be sent at peak engagement times or when the user is not available to manually post on social media.
